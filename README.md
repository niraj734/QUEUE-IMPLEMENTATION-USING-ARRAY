1.HEY GUYS THE ABOVE CODE IS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF QUEUE DATA STRUCTURE USING ARRAY.
2.QUEUE IS A LINEAR DATA STRUCTURE,ALIKE STACK QUEUE ALSO FOLLOWS A PRINCIPLE WHICH IS KNOWN AS FIFO(first in first out) i.e THE ELEMENT WHICH IS INSERTED FIRST WILL BE THE ELEMENT TO BE DELETED FIRST.
3.QUEUE HAS TWO POINTERS NAMED front and rear.Front points to the first element of the queue and Rear points to the last element of the queue.
4.THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN STACK AND QUEUE IS IN REMOVING THE ELEMENT,IN STACK THE ELEMENT AT THE TOP WILL BE DELETED FIRST AND IN QUEUE THE ELEMENT WHICH IS INSRTED FIRST WILL BE THE ELEMENT TO BE DELETED FIRST.
5.IN STACK WHILE INSERTING TOP POINTER WAS INCREMENTED BY 1 AND WHILE REMOVING THE ELEMENT THE TOP POINTER WAS DECREMENTED BY 1,WHEREAS IN QUEUE IF WE INSERT AN ELEMENT THE REAR WILL BE INCREMENRTED BY 1 AND IF WE REMOVE AN ELEMENT FORM THE QUEUE THE FRONT WILL BE INCREMENTED BY 1
WHICH MEANS IN QUEUE ONLY INCREMENTATION IS DONE.
6.THE DEAFULT OF VALUES OF BOTH THE POINTERS IS SET TO BE -1 explicitly.
7.THE QUEUE IS SAID TO BE EMPTY IF FRONT==-1 OR REAR==-1.
8.WHEN OUR QUEUE'S CAPACITY IS FULL AND WE ARE ONCE AGAIN INSERTING AN ELEMENT THEN THIS WILL LEAD TO STACK OVERFLOW.
9.WHEN OUR QUEUE IS EMEPTY AND WE ARE REMOVING AN ELEMENT THEN THIS WILL LEAD TO STACK UNDERFLOW.
10.INSERTING A ELEMENT IN QUEUE IS KNOWN AS ENQUEUE.
11.DELETEING OR REMOVING AN ELEMENT FROM THE QUEUE IS KNOWN AS DEQUEUE.
